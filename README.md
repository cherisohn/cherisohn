- 👋 Hi, I’m @cherisohn
- 👀 I’m interested in growing as a programmer who has no degree in CS! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html
- ✅ My goal is to upload 1 commit a day :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with fellow learners since I'm teaching myself, I'd love to meet others who are in the same position as myself
- 📫 How to reach me: chaeheesohn@gmail.com
