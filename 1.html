<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Chaehee, a.k.a Cheri. I'm learning html right now and today is my <strong><u>first</u> try</strong>! I just quit my job as an English teacher and pursuing <strong>my new dream to be a programmer</strong> :)</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;"">Also, I'm currently conductiong a project called 갓생살기, which allows me to clean and vacuum more, study harder, workout more often, and so on. I also love playing games! My favorite these days is Valorant, Riot's FPS game. I'm not a ranker yet, but my goal is to be a Gold player hopefully soon.</p>
